                    I am currently a Junior at the University of Rochester. I am studying Business with a concentration in Finance. I plan on completing a minor in math and computer science, hopefully.

                    I enjoy playing video games and drawing in my free time. My favorite video game is the Dark Souls series. Right now, I am trying to beat Dark Souls 3. I also like cars. This Spring I bought my first car, a Subaru BRZ. My favorite TV show is Game of Thrones and my favorite movie is Pulp Fiction. I have a Pulp Fiction poster hanging in my room.
