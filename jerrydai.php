        <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Hi my name is Jerry and I am a junior at the U of R. I'm from Queens, NY but my parents moved to Brooklyn from China when they were in their early 20s. My hobbies are music, lifting, and cooking. My favorite foods include halal, vodka slices, and sushi. This past summer I worked at the Greater Flushing Chamber of Commerce, where I developed a neighborhood web portal to promote Flushing, NY as part of a district marketing campaign.

        <h2>LinkedIn Bio</h2>
        <p>
            Junior at the University of Rochester interested in the importance of technology in businesses. On the fun side of things, I'm a drummer for the Rock Repertory Ensemble at the University of Rochester, I participated in the "Code Suisse" coding challenge at Credit Suisse, I've been on live TV playing piano at a talent show, and I've spent one summer as a paddler on the NY Metro Athletic Dragons dragon-boating team.
        </p>
        
        <h2>My Pet Fish Bolt</h2>
        <p>
            I have a pet betta fish named Bolt. I named him Bolt because he is blue, and at the store, I saw him only swimming vertically.
